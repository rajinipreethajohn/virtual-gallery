# Virtual Gallery

Creating a gallery with towering art installations that make the viewer feel small would create a powerful, immersive experience. Let me help you plan this project.

Project Vision:
A virtual 3D gallery where users navigate through themed rooms featuring gigantic artwork displays on high walls, creating a sense of awe and scale. The human-controlled character will be small in comparison, emphasizing the grandeur of the art.

Outlining a comprehensive approach using Three.js, which would give the most flexibility for creating this experience:
